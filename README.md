In the era of streaming, the simple question “What should we watch?” has become work. With multiple services and endless catalogs, people hit choice overload fast. StreamBuddies is a unified hub that surfaces everything you can actually watch across the subscriptions you already pay for. Getting started is quick: log your services and sync contacts. Create friend groups for watch nights, and StreamBuddies automatically builds a shared catalog that includes only titles available to everyone in the group. From there, deciding, queuing, and pressing play is simple.
